# Gehaltsabrechnung
With this ipynb R.B. employes can get rid of renaming .pdf files manually

Problem:
R.B. employees can download their salary documents as .pdf. How ever they are automatically named as "Nachweis.pdf" or if more than one file has been downloaded Windows will extend the naming to "Nachweis(x).pdf" where x increases with every new download.

How to use the script:
Place Renaming_Gehaltsabrechnung.ipynb in the same folder as all the downloaded .pdf files and execute it.
All different types of .pdf will then be copied and renamed into the corresponding year folder the document is refearing to.

File types supported:
- Entgeltnachweis
- Zusatzinformation zur Entgeltabrechnung
- Lohnsteuerbescheinigung
- Meldebescheinigung zur Sozialversicherung
    x also Krankenkassenwechsel are supported
